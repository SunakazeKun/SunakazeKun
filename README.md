Greetings! I'm Aurum, a Computer Science student and video game hacking enthusiast from Germany. In my free time, I engage in researching the internal structures of various video games. Using the gathered information, I create my own modifications, hacks and tools. In 2016, I began programming as a hobby and worked with a few programming and assembly languages since then, including
- Python
- Java
- C++
- gbZ80
- PowerPC
